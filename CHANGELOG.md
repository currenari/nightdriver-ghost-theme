## [1.1.0] - 2026-02-12
### Added
- Added Snipcart cart summary controls (`count` and `total`) in the header:
  desktop top bar and mobile utility bar.

### Changed
- Reduced the header-to-content spacing on the homepage by tightening the
  top padding of the Featured Posts section.
- Updated Snipcart setup to use the official embed pattern while continuing to
  source the public API key from Ghost Admin custom settings.

### Fixed
- Corrected Snipcart add-to-cart button styling so enabling the API key no
  longer forces an unintended white/default-looking button style.
- Cleaned and consolidated duplicated/conflicting Snipcart and CTA CSS rules.
